Hello Marcin,

now we nearly have our order together. This are the flipdots we want to try:

Pos - 1 €9,18   2 * NO 01 - 30NR stopped color 1* green/black 1*red/black  
Pos - 2 €9,86   1 * NO 04 - 30ND stopped color yellow/black  
Pos - 3 €4      2 * NO 07 - 36NR stopped color 1*yellow/black 1*red/black  
Pos - 4 €4      2 * NO 08 - 54NR stopped color green/black  
Pos - 5 €4      2 * NO 09 - 36NR unstopped color red/green  
Pos - 6 €4      2 * NO 10 - 54NR unstopped color red/green  

-----------

If we dont need any other gear, like headmounting or so to use the small 7 segment display then we would order:

Pos - 7 €10     2 * 107SS7-07SC SSM color White  

This is about 80,22 euro before taxes. 

If the full invoice without taxes but wuth shipment does not exceed 100€ we would take also a flipdot stripe. Important is for us that we don't exceed 100€ before taxes because then we can just order right away. If the invoice is higher then 100€ we need to make a request for the order. So please contact me first if the order exeeds 100€

Pos 1 - € 18,36  
Pos 2 - €  9,86  
Pos 3 - €  8  
Pos 4 - €  8
